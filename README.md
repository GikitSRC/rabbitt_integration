# 🐇 Rabbitt
These scripts uses your Rabbit R1's Note-saving feature to perform actions on your computer, like sending a message to someone on Discord!

---

# 🚀 How to install:
Simply run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GikitSRC/rabbitt_integration
cd rabbitt_integration
npm init -y
npm install
npx playwright install
node [scriptname].js
```
Customize [scriptname].js to the script you want to use it for! <br>
You must open up the script with any text editor, and replace the placeholder credentials with your own.

# 🔧 How to use:
Just say this to your R1:
```bash
Save this as a note: Send a message to {name} with the content of {message}
```
And, once the script detects it (~10 seconds) it will send the message (another ~10 seconds)
